# Friday the 13th
Friday the 13th - Minecraft Edition is a plugin for you Bukkit/Spigot server that enables players to experience Jason in all of his glory. Play as Jason or one of your favorite counselors as you fight to survive or fight to kill. Featuring customized gameplay as Jason and counselor, players have perks, abilities, and objects to aid in their mission. Hide behind doors, break them down, cut the power, try to repair it if you dare - Friday the 13th is an extensive gameplay addition to your server.

## Deprecation
This version of Friday the 13th Minecraft was written with it's own internal arena management. I've begun working on creating my own Minecraft game plugin engine, Tobnet. This version and repository of F13 is now archived and won't be supported moving forward. F13 is being re-written on top of the Tobnet engine for longer sustainability and maintenance.
